I wanted to start this off with a bear joke, but you wouldn’t be able to bear it. Whatever.

## What is BearHub

BearHub syncs your [Bear App](https://bear.app) notes with your website’s Statamic collections.
Because of that, you can write your articles across many websites in the beautiful Bear markdown editor and sync them with your sites whenever you want.
You can even create and edit your articles on the go if you are subscribed to the Bear Pro plan!

## The Perfect Blogging Workflow

1. Write them in the beautiful & simplistic [Bear Notes](https://bear.app) app.
2. Tag them with your favorite taxonomy terms
3. Sync them via command or a dashboard widget

> It even works with images!

## Notes

Bear app only stores your notes locally on your computer for privacy reasons.
Since BearHub requires the local Bear app database, you will need to sync your notes locally and then push the changes to your remote server.

Easy, simple, and beautiful — that’s what BearHub ([Bear App](https://bear.app) + Statamic) is.
